# Crumbs Roadmap
#
# Each release delivers use cases that validate specific functionality.
# Complete releases in order, prioritizing the earliest incomplete release.
# Read together with VISION.md and ARCHITECTURE.md.

prioritization_rules:
  - Complete releases in order (finish N before starting N+1)
  - Minor releases (X.1, X.2) validate completed releases
  - Unscheduled (99.0) only when all scheduled releases complete

updating_rules:
  - Update use case status when completed
  - Assign new use cases to existing release if scope fits
  - Create minor release (e.g., 01.1) for additions to completed release
  - Add to 99.0 if not yet scheduled

releases:
  - version: "01.0"
    name: Core Storage with SQLite Backend
