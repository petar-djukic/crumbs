title: Links Interface
problem: |
  Links represent directed edges in the entity graph. They connect crumbs to trails (belongs_to), crumbs to crumbs (child_of), trails to crumbs (branches_from), and stashes to trails (scoped_to). Link requirements are currently scattered across four PRDs (prd-sqlite-backend, prd-trails-interface, prd-stash-interface, prd-crumbs-interface), making it difficult to understand the complete link behavior and constraints.

  This PRD consolidates all link requirements into one authoritative source. Other PRDs should reference prd-links-interface for link behavior rather than duplicating these specifications. The Link entity is the only entity without a dedicated interface PRD; this document fills that gap.
goals:
  - G1: Define the Link struct with all required fields
  - G2: Define valid link types and their semantics
  - G3: Document CRUD operations via the Table interface
  - G4: Define filter keys and query semantics
  - G5: Document uniqueness constraint and indexes
  - G6: Consolidate cardinality rules from other PRDs
  - G7: Document error handling
  - G8: Define graph audit functions for integrity validation
requirements:
  R1:
    title: Link Struct
    items:
      - R1.1: The Link struct must include the following fields
        detail: |
          | Field | Type | Description |
          |-------|------|-------------|
          | LinkID | string | UUID v7, generated on creation |
          | LinkType | string | Relationship type (see R2) |
          | FromID | string | Source entity ID |
          | ToID | string | Target entity ID |
          | CreatedAt | time.Time | Timestamp of creation |
      - R1.2: LinkID must be a UUID v7 (time-ordered) generated by the backend when Table.Set is called with an empty LinkID
      - R1.3: FromID and ToID are entity IDs; the entity type depends on LinkType (see R2)
      - R1.4: CreatedAt must be set to the current time on creation
      - R1.5: Links are immutable after creation. To change a relationship, delete the old link and create a new one
  R2:
    title: Link Types and Semantics
    items:
      - R2.1: LinkType must be one of the four valid types
        detail: |
          | LinkType | From Entity | To Entity | Semantics |
          |----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
          | belongs_to | Crumb | Trail | Crumb membership in trail. When trail completes, link removed (crumb becomes permanent). When trail abandoned, crumb deleted. |
          | child_of | Crumb | Crumb | Crumb dependency. Child is blocked until parent reaches pebble state. Forms DAG within or across trails. |
          | branches_from | Trail | Crumb | Trail branch point. Trail explores alternative path from this crumb. |
          | scoped_to | Stash | Trail | Stash scoped to trail. Shares trail lifecycle. Global stashes have no scoped_to link. |
      - R2.2: Link type constants must be defined in pkg/types/link.go
        detail: |
          ```go
          const (
              LinkTypeBelongsTo    = "belongs_to"
              LinkTypeChildOf      = "child_of"
              LinkTypeBranchesFrom = "branches_from"
              LinkTypeScopedTo     = "scoped_to"
          )
          ```
      - R2.3: Table.Set must reject unrecognized LinkType values with ErrInvalidData
      - R2.4: The graph formed by child_of links must be a DAG (no cycles). See R8 for validation
  R3:
    title: CRUD via Table Interface
    items:
      - R3.1: Links are accessed via the Table interface
        detail: |
          ```go
          linksTable, _ := cupboard.GetTable("links")
          ```
      - R3.2: To create a link, construct a Link struct and pass it to Table.Set with an empty ID
        detail: |
          ```go
          link := &Link{
              LinkType: "belongs_to",
              FromID:   crumbID,
              ToID:     trailID,
          }
          linkID, err := linksTable.Set("", link)
          ```
      - R3.3: Table.Set must generate a UUID v7 for LinkID, set CreatedAt to now, and persist to both SQLite and links.jsonl
      - R3.4: Table.Get retrieves a link by LinkID. Returns ErrNotFound if not found. Returns ErrInvalidID if id is empty
        detail: |
          ```go
          entity, err := linksTable.Get(linkID)
          link := entity.(*Link)
          ```
      - R3.5: Table.Delete removes a link by LinkID. Returns ErrNotFound if not found. Returns ErrInvalidID if id is empty
      - R3.6: Table.Fetch queries links matching a filter map. Returns []any that must be type-asserted to *Link
  R4:
    title: Filter Keys
    items:
      - R4.1: Supported filter keys for links
        detail: |
          | Key | Value Type | Description |
          |-----|------------|-------------|
          | LinkID | string | Match by link ID (exact match) |
          | LinkType | string | Match by link type |
          | FromID | string | Match by source entity ID |
          | ToID | string | Match by target entity ID |
          | CreatedAt | string | Match by creation timestamp |
      - R4.2: Multiple filter keys are ANDed. A link must match all specified criteria
        detail: |
          ```go
          // Find all crumbs belonging to a specific trail
          filter := map[string]any{
              "LinkType": "belongs_to",
              "ToID":     trailID,
          }
          links, _ := linksTable.Fetch(filter)
          ```
      - R4.3: An empty or nil filter matches all links
      - R4.4: Unknown filter keys must be ignored (forward compatibility)
  R5:
    title: Uniqueness Constraint
    items:
      - R5.1: The combination (link_type, from_id, to_id) must be unique
        detail: |
          ```sql
          UNIQUE (link_type, from_id, to_id)
          ```
      - R5.2: Table.Set must reject duplicate links with the same (link_type, from_id, to_id) combination
      - R5.3: A crumb can have at most one belongs_to link (because the combination crumb+belongs_to+trail is unique)
      - R5.4: A crumb can have multiple child_of links (different parent crumbs) and be the target of multiple child_of links (multiple children)
      - R5.5: Indexes for efficient queries
        detail: |
          ```sql
          CREATE INDEX idx_links_type_from ON links(link_type, from_id);
          CREATE INDEX idx_links_type_to ON links(link_type, to_id);
          ```
  R6:
    title: Cardinality Rules
    items:
      - R6.1: "belongs_to cardinality: A crumb can belong to at most one trail at a time. Enforced by uniqueness constraint on (belongs_to, crumb_id, *)"
      - R6.2: "child_of cardinality: Many-to-many. A crumb can have multiple parents and multiple children. The child_of graph must be a DAG (no cycles)"
      - R6.3: "branches_from cardinality: A trail can have at most one branches_from link. Enforced by uniqueness constraint on (branches_from, trail_id, *)"
      - R6.4: "scoped_to cardinality: A stash can have at most one scoped_to link. Enforced by uniqueness constraint on (scoped_to, stash_id, *)"
      - R6.5: Cardinality summary table
        detail: |
          | Link Type | From Cardinality | To Cardinality |
          |-----------|------------------|----------------|
          | belongs_to | crumb → one trail | trail ← many crumbs |
          | child_of | crumb → many crumbs | crumb ← many crumbs |
          | branches_from | trail → one crumb | crumb ← many trails |
          | scoped_to | stash → one trail | trail ← many stashes |
  R7:
    title: Error Handling
    items:
      - R7.1: Link operations must return the following sentinel errors
        detail: |
          | Error | When |
          |-------|------|
          | ErrNotFound | Link ID does not exist (Table.Get, Table.Delete) |
          | ErrInvalidID | Link ID is empty (Table.Get, Table.Delete) |
          | ErrInvalidData | LinkType is not recognized, or FromID/ToID is empty |
          | ErrCupboardDetached | Cupboard has been detached |
      - R7.2: All errors must be checkable with errors.Is
      - R7.3: Uniqueness constraint violations (duplicate link) must return an error from Table.Set. The specific error depends on the backend implementation
  R8:
    title: Graph Audit Functions
    items:
      - R8.1: The backend must provide audit functions to validate graph integrity
        detail: |
          | Audit Function | Description |
          |----------------|-------------|
          | ValidateDAG | Ensure no cycles exist in child_of links |
          | ValidateReferences | Ensure all link from_id and to_id reference existing entities |
          | ValidateBelongsTo | Ensure each crumb belongs to at most one trail |
          | ValidateBranchesFrom | Ensure each trail has at most one branches_from link |
          | ValidateScopedTo | Ensure each stash has at most one scoped_to link |
          | ValidateTrailCrumbs | Ensure abandoned trails have no crumbs |
      - R8.2: ValidateDAG must detect cycles using depth-first search or topological sort. If a cycle is found, return an error listing the crumb_ids involved
      - R8.3: ValidateReferences must validate all link types
        detail: |
          | Link Type | from_id must exist in | to_id must exist in |
          |-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
          | belongs_to | crumbs | trails |
          | child_of | crumbs | crumbs |
          | branches_from | trails | crumbs |
          | scoped_to | stashes | trails |
      - R8.4: Audit functions run on startup after loading JSONL. If validation fails, Attach returns an error
      - R8.5: Audit functions are also available as Cupboard methods for on-demand validation
non_goals:
  - This PRD does not define cascade behavior on trail completion or abandonment. See prd-trails-interface for cascade semantics
  - This PRD does not define entity-specific query patterns (e.g., finding all crumbs in a trail). Those patterns are documented in the entity-specific PRDs
  - This PRD does not define link update operations. Links are immutable; delete and recreate to modify
  - This PRD does not change the existing Link implementation
acceptance_criteria:
  - Link struct defined with LinkID, LinkType, FromID, ToID, CreatedAt
  - Link types documented (belongs_to, child_of, branches_from, scoped_to)
  - Link type constants defined in pkg/types/link.go
  - CRUD operations specified via Table interface
  - Filter keys documented (LinkID, LinkType, FromID, ToID, CreatedAt)
  - AND semantics for multiple filter keys documented
  - Uniqueness constraint documented (link_type + from_id + to_id)
  - Cardinality rules consolidated from other PRDs
  - Error types documented (ErrNotFound, ErrInvalidID, ErrInvalidData, ErrCupboardDetached)
  - Graph audit functions documented (ValidateDAG, ValidateReferences, etc.)
  - All requirements numbered and specific
constraints:
  - LinkID uses UUID v7 for time-ordering and uniqueness
  - LinkType is a string for JSON serialization (not a Go enum)
  - All timestamps use time.Time (RFC 3339 in JSON)
  - Links are stored in the links table (SQLite) and links.jsonl (source of truth)
  - Links are immutable after creation
