title: Self-Hosting with Epics via Trails
description: |
  Validates trail-based epic management for self-hosting workflows. Tests the
  complete lifecycle of using trails as epic containers: creating trails,
  associating crumbs via belongs_to links, querying crumbs by trail, completing
  trails (crumbs become permanent), and abandoning trails (crumbs deleted).
