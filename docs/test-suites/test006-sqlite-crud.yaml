title: Table interface CRUD operations
description: >
  Validates the Table interface CRUD operations (Get, Set, Delete, Fetch) through the
  SQLite backend. Tests cover creating entities with UUID v7 generation, retrieving
  entities with field fidelity, updating entities, querying with filters, deleting
  entities, error handling for nonexistent IDs, cross-table behavior, JSONL persistence,
  and post-detach error handling.
