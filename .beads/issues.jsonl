Stashes provide shared resources, artifacts, context, and coordination primitives (counters, locks) with full change history.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCrumbs are individual work items. Trails group them. But there's no mechanism for crumbs to share runtime state. When multiple agents coordinate on work, they need:\n- Shared resources (files, URLs, connections)\n- Artifacts (outputs from one crumb as inputs to another)\n- Context (decisions, configuration)\n- Coordination primitives (locks, counters)\n\nStash is a new first-class entity that provides this shared state with versioning and history.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n1. PRD: Stash Interface - Stash struct, StashHistory, types, operations\n2. PRD update: Cupboard Core - Add Stashes() accessor\n3. PRD update: SQLite Backend - Add stashes.json, stash_history.json, schema\n\n## Design Summary\n\n- Stash scoped to trail (or global if trail_id is null)\n- Types: resource, artifact, context, counter, lock\n- All mutations create history entries with version, operation, changedBy\n- Interface includes GetHistory and GetValueAtVersion for auditing","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"petar.djukic@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-02-04T13:54:31.561381-05:00","created_by":"petardjukic","updated_at":"2026-02-04T14:02:11.498943-05:00","closed_at":"2026-02-04T14:02:11.498943-05:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
